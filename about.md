Hi, I'm Will. I grew up in Greenville, North Carolina, attended college at the University of Pennslyvania, and live and work in New York City. 

I've always been interested in technology - from DIY projects to creating iOS apps in high school. During college, I was involved with early stage startups on both sides of the table: first at [Dorm Room Fund](https://dormroomfund.com), a student-run VC fund, and then as a co-founder of SolutionLoft, a data engineering startup. About a year and a half ago, I joined [Applecart](https://www.applecart.co/), where I started the data acquisition team and now help run the engineering organization.

My interests center around programming, data, statistics, startups and the future. At Penn, I studied statistics at Wharton and international studies in
the College. This site houses very _infrequent_ posts and a more-or-less up-to-date reading list (by virtue of linking to Goodreads).
