Hi, I'm Will. I grew up in Greenville, North Carolina and recently graduated
from college and moved to New York. I'm currently working on
[SolutionLoft](https://www.solutionloft.com), where we're focused on maximizing
developer productivity through code reuse.

My interests center around programming, data, statistics, politics, and the
future. At Penn, I studied statistics at Wharton and international studies in
the College.
