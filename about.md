title: About Me
---

My name is William Fry (you can call me Will), and I'm a junior at the University of Pennsylvania. I study international studies and business, as a student in the [Huntsman Program](http://huntsman.upenn.edu/). My interests lie in tech, philosophy, music and entrepreneurship.

I'm currently working on a [project](http://solutionloft.com) related to program synthesis and crowd-sourced development and doing freelance coding for a VC and startup. Previously, I've been an engineering intern for [First Round Capital's](http://firstround.com/) Platform Team. During my first two years of school, I served on [Dorm Room Fund](http://dormroomfund.com/) as an investment team member and, subsequently, a managing partner. Prior to that, I interned at [RaisedBy.Us](http://raisedby.us/) and [Two Toasters](http://twotoasters.com) (recently acquired by Ticketmaster).


I speak German (and studied abroad in Berlin in Spring '15). I program in Node.js, Python and Rails.
