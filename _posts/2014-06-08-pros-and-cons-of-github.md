I was recently putting together some information for a friend, who’s interning in finance, about the pros and cons of Github, to help with evaluating the company. The following is a brief breakdown of what I found in about 15 minutes of researching and drawing on experience.

## What Is Github?
Github, per Wikipedia, is a web-based hosting service that uses Git as the standard RVS (revision control system). An easy way to think about revision control is writing. Say you’re writing a book chapter by chapter and want to save different versions, in case you want to go back and change one piece or insert another. The site was launched in April of ’08, and boasts a couple million users with over 13 million repositories.

## Pros
- By far the most popular platform for storing code online, probably safe to say it’s the standard.
- Great and extensive documentation on how to interact with Git and Github from command line, Github’s desktop app, etc.
- Enables enterprises and teams to work together and collaborate.
- The massive community makes Github one of the quickest ways to resolve issues, ask questions, or better other’s code. Most issues are immediately answered by one of the contributors or one who has used the library / module before.
- Recently launched Github.io, or Github Pages, which allows users to run code from their repositories live on a website. One way Github has tried to vertically integrate and fight off competition from Heroku or AWS.
- Github also owns Gist, a sick tool where you can paste snippets of code to easily share with co-developers. Takes away the annoying code-sending via chat rooms like Slack and Hip Chat.

## Cons
- Most developers prefer private repositories (since their code is often proprietary), and Github charges for even one private repository.
- The price tiers for private repositories and enterprises is quite high in comparison with Bitbucket, which offers 1-5 private repositories for free. Each tier after that is usually $15 cheaper than Github’s tier.
- Github maxes out repositories at 125, whereas Bitbucket allows individuals to create unlimited repos.
- Github only supports Git revision control. While that is the most common, Bitbucket and other services support Mercurial and Subversion as well.
- Github only allows authentication via Github, a bit of a hassle compared to services that streamline the process via Facebook, Google, or Twitter auth.

## Sidenotes
- Github has received $100M in Series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz and SV Angel, both of which are well-known and established leaders in Venture Capital. The last was in 2012, when they received a $750M valuation.
- New competitors have emerged in the field of real-time collaboration coupled with cloud-hosted development environments (i.e. Koding.com and Terminal.com).
- Github recently acquired Easel, which is a startup that competes in the aforementioned field. This was in January of 2014.
Bottomline
- Github is ballin’ and won’t be stopped soon. It’s grown massively and hosts most every popular, open-sourced library. It’s recent acquisition plus the fact that AH was a key investor just goes to prove that Github isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
