##1: Global and Medieval (Schizophrenic Economy)

- Until late 1990s the most significant highway was the Grand Trunk Road, which went bisected India from North to South
    - It was a single lane highway, avg speed of 30 mph
- By 2006, the 3000 mile Golden Quadrilateral was completed
    - Connected Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata
- Modern and booming service sector in a sea of indifferent farm land
- Jawaharial Nehru
    - Forged consensus in which India would aim for complete economic self-sufficiency
    - The State would lead the effort by building up heavy industry (steel plants and large dams)
    - Nehru is now regarded as a “hopeless idealist"
    - Advisors were brought in from MIT and Gosplan (Soviet Union) to help with state planning
    - Two main goals:
        - swaraj: self-rule (political)
        - swadeshi: self-reliance (economic)
    - This concept of a closed economy dominated by the state pleased Britain’s Labour party (the same responsible for nationalization of industry in Britain)
    - These plans didn’t work — By late 20th century, China had 2x the standard of living of India, despite both being at the same welfare level at 1949 and including the fact that China spent the first 30 years enacting a rule of terror
- Why did it fail?
    - At independence, the country was very rural (agricultural) and impoverished
        - 9/10 lived in villages
        - 1951: Literacy rate for 320M was only 16%, Avg life expectancy was 32
    - Needed land reform, not heavy industry via state
    - Needed to be literate and access to anti-malaria medicine and antibiotics
    - Instead, Nehru poured resources into forming universities in the cities for the urban middle class and building public hospitals
    - First 5 Year Plan was in 1951
        - Only 1/3 of budget was for agriculture when it made up so much of economy / life
        - Disparity from elite’s utopian dreams and reality
    - He did get rid of Zamindari system
        - Large landholders, zamindars, collected taxes from peasants for the British
    - Other reforms were stopped by the Congress Party elites, who were drawn from upper castes
        - i.e. cooperatives similar to China’s were shutdown by local leaders
        - Nehru became jealous of China’s ability to push through major reform without democratic hurdles
    - Failure of overall model
        - 1. 1967:
            - Indira Gandhi was forced to devaluate the rupee by the U.S. and IMF
            - Symbolic defeat for swadeshi
            - She suspended democracy for 19 months amid protests over her failure to “remove poverty” (1975)

    - Limitations
        - India does not wish to play the role of strategic counterbalance to China; wants to remain equidistant from China and U.S. (or at least not admit openly)
        - India’s relations with other countries, including those labeled as “rogue” by U.S.
            - i.e. Iran
        - Anemic growth in trade between two; More specifically the slow growth of U.S. exports to India
            - “Sanctity of the contract” not completely understood by Indians as by Americans
                - i.e. 2400-megawatt Dabhol power plant near Mumbai that was built in 1990s by Enron
                - Maharashtra gov refused to buy electricity because it was “overpriced"
            - Slow liberalization of India’s retail, insurance and banking sectors
                - Nevertheless, 80% of India’s software earnings come from American customers
- Indian foreign diplomacy is often centered around being treated with exceptional respect
    - Appear to mind more about etiquette than substance
    - “Whether a realist or an idealist, almost every member of the Indian strategic community thinks that India’s inherent greatness as a power is itself a valuable diplomatic asset. India’s ambassadors are expected to persuade foreign officials of the wisdom and moral correctness of the Indian position, say, by stating the Indian case, and supplementing political arguments with information about India’s great civilization, its cultural and economic accomplishments and its democratic orientation” — Stephen Cohen
    - Very against third-party opinions or mediation
    - In the last decade or two, India has become a more practical power
- Energy security actually bigger problem than food security
    - In the last 25 years, India has made significant progress in food supply difficulties and will likely become large exporter
    - Currently imports 70% of oil needs, expected to rise to 90%
    - Similar energy situation to China (large reserves of coal but insufficient supplies of oil)
        - Both have built controversial dams
        - Both have ambitions to expand civil nuclear capacity
        - Both want to extract oil or gas directly rather than buy energy futures
    - India has struck significant undersea gas fields in Bay of Bengal
    - Issue with possible trade with Iran (enough gas and oil)
        - U.S. Helms-Burton Act triggers sanctions on companies that trade with Iran and Libya
- Now has aid programs in parts of Africa and Afghanistan
    - Tool of foreign policy as much as an expression of humanitarian concern

    - The sector is very meritocratic
    - Change in values accompany increase in wealth

    - Among many of the Christian and Muslim communities, the form of worship is more eclectic and unorthodox than among their coreligionists in most other parts of the world

##Conclusion: Hers to Lose (India’s Huge Opportunities and Challenges in the Twenty-First Century)
- “one percent society” - whichever economic or social indicator you chose is improving roughly at 1% a year
    - poverty rate, literacy rate, life expectancy
- India has given higher priority to stability than it has to efficiency
- India has 18 official languages, several different scripts, and deep religious and caste divisions
- To thrive, India’s businesses need good infrastructure, a literate and healthy workforce, a sustainable environment, and the promise of law and order
- Four critical problems
    - (1) Lifting 300M people out of absolute poverty and of providing the remainder with a more secure standard of living
        - By 2050, India is projected to hit 1.6B; overtaking China by 2032
        - The more rapidly India can overcome poverty, the more likely its population will stabilize near 1B than 2B
        - Must raise its agricultural productivity
            - Create market for voluntary land sales so average plot size becomes large enough for mechanization
            - Allow farmers to sell to whom they choose
            - Liberalize retail sector to bring in cold storage facilities and new agribusinesses
            - Overhaul regressive system of food subsidies to the consumer, to encourage farmers to grow other crops

            - Workforce is expanding by 10M people every year
            - Only 5M new jobs are created every year
            - Must give better education and more vocational training
            - Must remove obstacles that inhibit investors
            - Reform labor laws
    - (2) Overcoming the dangers of rapid environmental degradation
        - Accounts for only 4% of global carbon dioxide emissions but has almost 17% of world population
        - The West, particularly U.S., should take a stronger lead in offering India and the rest of the developing world financial incentives to embark
        - By 2030, India is projected to have 200M vehicles compared to 40M vehicles in 2006
        - Possible solutions

            - Build metros in large cities
            - Use leapfrog innovation strategy for planning cleaner and more efficient urban transport systems

            - Develop coherent energy strategy
                - Current management is scattered across many different industries
    - (3) Heading off the specter of an HIV-AIDS epidemic
        - In 2005, less than 1% contracted HIV; this still makes India the second largest sufferer behind South Africa (5.3M)
        - They’ve managed this problem; According to AVERT, in 2013 only 0.3% contracted HIV with a total of 2.1M people
        - Cipla, based in Mumbai, has done more than any other company in the world to bring affordable AIDs treatments to millions of sub-Saharan Africans
    - (4) Protecting and strengthening India’s system of liberal democracy, which is most precious asset India possesses
        - Most coherent threat is Hindu nationalism
            - The Sangh Parivar (Rss family of groups) controls India’s largest trade union, its largest student union, and the largest network of daily and weekly publications

            - Most obvious external threat is from Pakistan
            - Must improve relations with Bangladesh (c 1971)
            - South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
