### I. An Overview

Social choice theory, as described by Wulf Gaertner, is an attempt to aggregate preferences of members of a society in order to produce a function that represents the society as a whole (2013). The function is referred to as a social welfare function. Social choice theory strives for answers to the question: how can a group of individuals arrive at a decision that best satisfies the individuals’ wishes? The attempt to create a social welfare function yielding such a decision began with important contributions in the 18th century, yet modern work on collective choice began first with Kenneth Arrow’s Social Choice and Individual Values, which set the foundation for debate since the 1950s. Arrow claimed that arriving at any form of social welfare function is actually impossible, given the diverse preferences of individuals (1951).

This provocative assertion has given rise to responses from the leading voices of social choice and public choice theory. Current research examines Arrow’s General Possibility Theorem (more commonly referred to as Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem) and argues that it fails to take a pragmatic and holistic view of social welfare. The individual theorists reviewed surface complementary criticisms and improvements to this central theorem within social choice theory. This paper will review the key contributors to contemporary thought on the matter and their responses to Arrow’s theorem. The exact reasons for Arrow’s insufficient argument and the line of logic for conquering this impediment to further research and application of social choice theory are explained in the works of Amartya Sen, James M. Buchanan, Duncan Black and J.C. Weldon. In order to focus on the relevant and interesting issues and solutions to Arrow’s work, the mathematical proofs behind the theories (as used most extensively by Weldon) will be avoided in exchange for more analytical explanations of the logic.

### II. Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem

In an effort to understand the implications and criticisms of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, an explanation is required. His theorem claims that given a set of conditions, which would yield a satisfactory social welfare function, there exists no such function that yields a social preference constructed from diverse individual preferences and still satisfies the set of conditions. The set of conditions for is of upmost importance. The exact number of conditions varies depending upon how one analyzes his argument. The five conditions noted in Weldon’s work will be explained, since they provide the clearest explanation. The first condition states that the social orderings must be rational in relation to individual orderings. That is to say, if an individual prefers A to B and B to C, then the individual must prefer A to C. This logic must be represented by the social ordering – every combination of A, B, and C must be yielded consistently and done so rationally, what is referred to as universal domain by Sen (1995, p. 4). The second condition requires that the social ranking of an alternative not fall if the individual ranking of that alternative rises – this would be illogical and result in an inverse function. The third condition of independence of irrelevant alternatives argues that the social ranking of a pair of alternatives should depend on the individual ranking of only that pair and not on irrelevant alternatives (Ibid.). In simpler terms, if a pair was to be ranked higher than alternative pairs, then removing the alternative pairs shouldn’t affect the ranking of the selected pair.

These three conditions are the bases for any rational collective choice or rather require ‘social intelligence’ in the words of Weldon (1952, p. 453). They are the bare minimum. The last two conditions beg the question of impossibility. The fourth condition argues that the social preferences should not be independent of individual preferences; rather, the social orderings must not be imposed on the individual. Sometimes referred to as the Pareto principle, this means that the individual’s preference plays a role in determining the greater social preference. Lastly, social orderings cannot be determined solely by the preferences of a single individual, otherwise known as ‘dictated’ (Buchanan, 1954, p. 115). Arrow believes that simultaneously satisfying the last two conditions is impossible. In the words of Weldon, an individual either always has his fate fixed for him (in violation of the fourth condition) or single-handedly fixes his fate (in violation of the fifth condition).

### III. Resulting Research

Understandably, these conditions and the resulting conclusion provide a challenge for all researchers in the field of social choice and public choice theory. It claims that processes such as voting do not reach a social welfare because voting behavior cycles during the election seasons. Inevitably, if a function were made from a certain point in the cycle, using it for the next election would impose the result on the voters (their fate would be fixed), as their individual preferences would have changed. Such a restriction on a clearly favorable process highlights the lack of pragmatism in Arrow’s logic. Review of current research, specifically the works of Black, Weldon, Buchanan, and Sen, reveals the implications of this theorem as well as various methods for dealing with the supposed impossibility.

Duncan Black, an economist in the 20th century, developed the idea of “single-peaked” preferences, a postulate used by Weldon in his critique (Black, 1948, p.24). “Single-peaked” preferences involve a utility function over a set of alternatives that has a single-peaked curve with respect to the set (e.g. one alternative is favored above all else). Black shows that single-peakedness can indeed produce an ordering that is rational (he applies this to majority voting), thus satisfying the first condition. Arrow’s own theory has shown steps that such qualities can satisfy the remaining four conditions; therefore, Black’s restricted single-peaked preferences can lead to a social welfare function (Weldon, 1952, p. 462). 

J.C. Weldon, a famous North American economist, uses Black’s work to find other functions, which are “satisfactory in similarly restricted circumstances” (Ibid.). His research gives an explanation for how this occurs by relating alternatives to a mixture of a specific pair of alternatives. He proposes that if it is necessary to move from ordinal measures to cardinal measures in such a specific circumstance as majority voting, it should be possible to do so in any circumstance. Weldon’s work is one of the first responses to Arrow and is widely referenced by later theorists.

On the other hand, James Buchanan, a contemporary to Weldon, believes that Weldon’s interpretation of Arrow’s work is incorrect (Buchanan, 1954, p.116). His work argues that Arrow’s theory, while incorrect itself, does not necessitate that decision-making satisfy his five conditions; rather, Arrow’s theory simply necessitates that social welfare functions and judgments, concepts that do not include decision-making mechanisms such as voting, account for satisfaction of the conditions. Buchanan attempts to clarify concepts that Arrow surfaced in order to specify the exact implications of his work. Buchanan argues that there are no actual implications for voting, as it is a desirable process despite its inconsistency (the changing of opinions) that violates the fourth condition (Ibid., p.121). He states that this is necessary given that values are not static but instead malleable. His research brings value formation into the discussion.

Amartya Sen, a Nobel-Prize-winning economist and philosopher, is one of the leading present-day theorists in this area. Similar to Buchanan’s aim, Sen addresses methodological and informational foundations of social choice theory and Arrow’s theorem in his 1991 work. Here he argues for freedom-based approaches to be considered, given that pure utility-based functions do not take into the account the lack of choice. He disputes previously held notions that preference fulfillment can be identified with individual welfare as well as that it is disconnected from individual freedom. In his 1995 work, he focuses more on analysis of social choice theory in the light of previous research. He reviews previous propositions in order to address questions of rationality in social decisions, value formation, and Buchanan’s dispute of social preference. He concedes arguments to both Arrow and Buchanan in hope of furthering a better understanding and direction, as he suggests key areas to incorporate into social choice theory research in the future by drawing on his 1991 argument for freedom (Sen, 1995, p.18). 

### IV. Looking Forward

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem incited a debate within the field of social choice that still goes on today. The question is no longer whether arriving at a social welfare function is possible. The question is what conditions, variables and parameters are required. Black’s single-peakedness was able to lay the question for how not if. Weldon applied Black’s work in showing a need for cardinal measures of utility, thus changing the conditions, and linking the many-alternative case to the two-alternative case. Buchanan found this unnecessary but did show that variables such as nonutility values are important. He thought that conditions of consistency should not limit decision-making processes. Sen found Buchanan to be correct on his argument for importance of decision-making processes, yet thought that even more variables and parameters should be included (value formation, interpersonal comparison, rationality of man) in the creation of social welfare functions. For every question answered, another is raised. The consensus of contemporary research is that Arrow fails to take a pragmatic and holistic view of social welfare.
