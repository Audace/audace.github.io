title: A Brief Guide to the Philly Tech Scene
comments: true
---

A friend recently asked me about the Philly tech scene as he knew someone moving here and looking to get involved. If there’s a time to get involved, it’s definitely now. Startups have the full support of the city (Mayor Nutter has been extremely proactive), funding sources, and the local universities. As Philly’s tech scene continues to grow and mature, I figured it’d be helpful to compile a brief guide to the current state.
