title: On Picking Partners

Whether it's a side project, a homework set, or the start of a new venture, we are continously faced with a dilemma: to pick someone we know, who may be less competent, or someone we don't know (or even dislike), who's known to be highly competent. This dilemma plagues everyone from Fortune 500 HR departments to middle schoolers. I argue that the correct decision depends solely on two factors: time and complexity.

The following table highlights the high-level scenarios given the two key variables at play. Person A is the known, less competent player. Person B is the unknown or unkind, more competent player.

|                | Lots of Time | Little Time |
|----------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
|**Very Complex**| Friend*      | Stranger    |
|**Less Complex**| Friend       | Friend      |

\*Assumes baseline of competence mentioned below.

The reason for the placement of the players is the value of certainty and propensity to learn. With a friend, you know his or her weaknesses and strengths. This certainty allows you to plan accordingly and prevent or account for his or her weaknesses. On the other hand, a stranger could be quite technically competent but be a terrible partner, given the many factors that go into cooperation and reciprocal work. Even the mean acquaintance has a level of uncertainty that is not parallel to that of your friend. This does not mean you should pick a friend as your partner, if he or she has absolutely no relevant strengths. It does mean that if you’re judging competence vs. closeness, go with a friend whose strengths and weaknesses you can account for. Uncertainty is to be avoided.

The second reason for the placement of the players is that competence follows the line of the below graph, where the x-axis is a measure of competence and the y-axis is propensity to learn. After a certain base level of competence, there is essentially an exponential capacity to learn or teach oneself how to solve problems.

Given that learning requires time, it is obvious that for short-term, complex tasks, where the stranger or mean acquaintance is known to be more competent than the friend, it is advantageous to work with that person. Any unknown weakness or strength of that person does not matter if completion of the task is urgent. However, as soon as time is not the driving restrictor to the task, optimize certainty and the propensity to learn – pick the friend as your partner.
