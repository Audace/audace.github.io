I really enjoy music. Lately, because of lack of time, I've been resorting to putting together playlists. At some point, I'd like to get back to playing piano or guitar and producing electronic music. Below are some playlists I've made - check them out and let me know what you like / don't like!

- [lounge](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ljsmVeKRrIgiAPDiIyI2i?si=T6W3ygndRBG_N9XPHggT2Q) - This playlist is mainly relaxed house and ambient music. If I owned a coffee shop or had friends over to chill and catch-up, I'd put this playlist on. Features artists like HNNY, Moodyman, Hidden Spheres, Motor City Drum Ensemle.
- [colombian water](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/06oukDB6stDHTH5HskSUpe?si=iUq2ec3rSx2iaWfth8aI_w) - This playlist was started by a friend of mine and played during a few days on the water in Cartagena. I took a number of the songs he found and extended it. I'd play this playlist if I was at the beach, on a boat, or on a roadtrip with good weather. It's upbeat, a bit funky. Has a lot of tropical, carribean and african undertones. Features artists like Penny Penny, Lou Bega, Coeo, Faze Action, Hugh Masekela.
- [friday afternoon](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1YADSEWMVrne3yKMLTDU27?si=IhG0jHdUSAyP8Y4l_hqDmg) - This playlist reminds me of driving home from high school on Friday. It's happy, upbeat. A lot of throwbacks to the 2000s, early 2010s. Features artists like Foster The People, Coldplay, Grouplove, MGMT, U2.
- [chill house](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1iT0FLg5duyDdudJY7Xd8U?si=5YyUlyMpS8eVl1LLTLSH-Q) - This playlist is similar to lounge in genre, but a bit more upbeat and takes on a more active role when played. Pretty house-y, with quick beats and more lyrics than the former. Features artists like Fouk, Mattei & Omich, Session Victim.
- [gonna be a good day](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6IC5ZCf76Z2wjbJ93a5umJ?si=AdSbTkeFT46QGUcCMnz0SQ) - This playlist is perfect for waking up in the morning with a good attitude. It runs across genres but with a common theme of classics that make you smile and give you a pep in your step. Features artists ranging from the B-52s to Bob Marley to Phil Collins.
- [sprinkler](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4tvmMayxvrr822QBzPjhrL?si=AzhI_OY5RA-vo3h0ZcdYRQ) - This playlist reminds me of hanging out with my friends back home and having a beer under the sun on a Saturday. It's upbeat, mainly soft rock. Features artists like Sugar Ray, The Expendables, Barenaked Ladies.
- [island burn](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5PhO6f3pfTCYgjqozOJqGT?si=r47T7SXPRDm7XlEbjvGGxA) - This playlist was started after my second trip to Mykonos. The sets at beach spots like Scorpios and Alemagou are amazing and really capture the vibe. Features artists like Black Coffee, Dennis Ferrer, Floyd Levine, Peggy Gou.
- [minimal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0jqXrPA3cyhL79q2clqmfU?si=RhDEbbTBSBGEpxXfiBzOSw) - This playlist has a ton of minimal music, a few days worth I think. I love minimal techno - grown to like it a lot over the past few years. I started putting this together a year ago and have been adding to it after many resolute events and a trip to Romania. Features artists like Ricardo Villalobos, Raresh, Arapu.
- [marlboro 27s](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7zdljAa3OFdL4MvYJah14h?si=YFQxXkvCRwayy0ZUdwSNbg) - This playlist was started in 2013. It's great for an espresso in the morning. It was named after my favorite pack of cigarettes back when I used to smoke. I used to play this playlist when having a smoke break on the weekend. Features artists like America, Arlo Guthrie, Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
- [30s, 40s, 50s](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3VKFeRpwCXPbdzWVL5F1gn?si=ie-Fj8uWTCqsWzk4q4TTog) - This playlist started in 2014, when I fell in love with my girlfriend. Used to play this while lying in bed. It's all the classics of those eras. Features artists like Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Dean Martin.
- [road trip - pop/rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6nb5efvKlDPukpccDIhrW5?si=58DI15HbQse9HGIhLlgxqA) - This playlist was one of two played during a roadtrip with a good friend from Seattle to Austin. It captures most of my music tastes during middle school and early high school. Features artists like Blink-182, The Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox Twenty.
- [road trip - country](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/43X5gpN9brGjSZvUW2TCOo?si=hnvx-JmUTGav4K_aZyNgYA) - This playlist was the second played during the roadtrip. Country was really big growing up in eastern NC and this playlist has the big hits from then. Reminds me of driving out to the beach on the weekend. Features artists like Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney.
